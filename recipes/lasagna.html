                <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made by layering sheets of pasta with rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and plenty of melted mozzarella and Parmesan. The dish is assembled in a casserole-style format, typically starting with sauce, followed by pasta, then cheese, and repeated in layers. Once baked to golden perfection, lasagna becomes a hearty, comforting meal with a delicious blend of textures and savory flavors. It's perfect for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prepping, as it often tastes even better the next day.</p>

            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the sauce</strong> - In a large pan, sauté chopped onions and garlic in olive oil, then add ground beef or sausage. Cook until browned, drain excess fat, then add tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and Italian seasoning. Simmer for 20–30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong> - Boil lasagna noodles according to package instructions (skip this step if using no-boil noodles). Drain and lay flat on a clean towel to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the ricotta layer</strong> - In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with an egg, salt, pepper, and optional herbs like parsley or spinach.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong> - In a baking dish, layer in this order: a bit of sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, Parmesan, then repeat layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with sauce and cheese on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong> - Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25–30 minutes, then uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes until bubbly and golden. Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
