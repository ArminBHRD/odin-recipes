        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cucumber salad is a light and refreshing dish made by thinly slicing fresh cucumbers and tossing them with a simple dressing of vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper, and a touch of sugar for balance. Often enhanced with thinly sliced red onions, fresh dill, or parsley, the salad is chilled for a short time to allow the flavors to meld. Some variations include yogurt or sour cream for a creamy texture. Itâ€™s a quick, healthy side dish that pairs well with grilled meats, sandwiches, or as part of a summer spread.</p>
